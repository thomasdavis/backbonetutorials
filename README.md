# Backbone Tutorials

This site is by no means the definitive guide to backbone.js and all corrections and contributions are welcome.

About Backbone Tutorials:

As single page apps and large scale javascript applications become more prominent on the web, useful resources for those developers who are jumping the ship are crucial.

I started this site to not only consolidate my understanding of backbone.js, but to also document what I have learned thus far for myself and others.
